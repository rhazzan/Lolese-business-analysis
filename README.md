# Lolese-business-analysis
This project applies data analysis techniques to uncover business insights, optimize operations, and support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving sales performance.
## Overview
Olawale Rabiu is the owner of a medium-sized enterprise that provides rental services for chairs, canopies, drums, and related items. Like many business owners, he aims to maximize profit and optimize operations. The challenge, however, was that he had no clear understanding of how his business had performed in previous years and needed clarity to make informed decisions.

Recognizing the risks of operating without proper insight, I offered to conduct a comprehensive analysis for him to give him a full understanding of his business performance. I collected his hard-copy record book, converted it into a digital format to enable efficient analysis, and cleaned the data to prepare it for detailed evaluation. I then performed a full analysis to help him understand the true state and trends of his business.

After reviewing the dashboard and report I created, he was able to make informed decisions that improved his operational performance and increased sales by 10% within a month. He also mentioned that the decision he had been planning to make before receiving the dashboard and report could have severely harmed his business, but he was grateful that he chose to act on the insights provided.
